# Twitter Media Bias Project

As part of my final project for my Predictive Analytics course, I developed a fully automated machine learning pipeline, including data importing, data preparation, data segregation, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment.

My thesis was that machine learning models would be able to perform well in distinguishing the Twitter styles of various American media outlets:  CNN, MSNBC, FoxNews, Newsmax, Democracynow, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Vox, New York Post, and Breitbart News. By scraping thousands of tweets from each of the aforementioned media outlets, I was able to create an automated pipeline to clean and normalize the data and run the cleaned data through 10 classification and regression machine leanring models.
